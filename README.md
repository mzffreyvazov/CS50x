# CS50x
This repo contains my solutions to the problem sets from Harvard's CS50x intro computer science course.  Topics covered include C programming, Python, SQL, web dev, algorithms, and data structures. Each problem set focuses on building out a different program, like a Caesar cipher, music synthesizer, web server, and database queries.
